# CDR Viewer on Laravel

[Installed demo](http://demo.antonzakharov.ru) (use demo / secret for demo access).

CDR viewer is a web application for Asterisk communication framework. It shows data stored in default `cdr` table.
This is my first project based on Laravel framework, that is made for meeting with new technologies.
